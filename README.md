##### Project Title-01: 
Making Childcare Affordable:  A Call to action for Government Officials 

##### Project Description: 
This project aims to advocate for policies and initiatives that make childcare more affordable and accessible for families. By conducting research, engaging stakeholders, and creating compelling advocacy materials, we seek to raise awareness among government officials about the importance of affordable childcare and the positive impact it can have on society.  

##### Project Title-02: 
EDA on popularity of music among various age people based on genre. 

##### Project Description: 
This project seeks to understand the relationship between age and music preferences, focusing on the popularity of different music genres among various age groups. By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we aim to uncover patterns and trends that can provide insights into musical tastes and preferences across demographics. 

##### Project Title-03: 
Process and Analyze Hotel Booking data using Big Data Components. 

##### Project Description:  
This project aims to leverage big data technologies to efficiently process and analyze extensive hotel booking data. By utilizing components of the big data ecosystem, such as Hadoop, Spark, and Hive, we can handle large datasets, perform complex analyses, and derive valuable insights to optimize hotel operations and improve customer experience. 

##### Project Title-04: 
Improving Passenger Experience Through Data-Driven Insights. 

##### Project Description: 
This AI project aims to enhance passenger experience in public transportation systems by leveraging data-driven insights. By analyzing various data sources such as ticketing, travel patterns, and passenger feedback, we can identify areas for improvement and implement strategies to provide a more seamless and satisfying travel experience. 

##### Project Title-05: 
Uncovering the Rise in Kia and Hyundai Vehicle Thefts: A Data-Driven Analysis and Prevention Strategy. 

##### Project Description:  
Analyzed the increasing rates of Kia and Hyundai vehicle thefts across major U.S. cities. Using data visualization and statistical analysis, the project provided insights into theft patterns, identifying potential causes and recommending preventive measures for law enforcement agencies. 

##### Project Title-06: 
Predictive analysis on Hotel Booking cancellation using Hotel booking data. 

##### Project Description: 
The project aims to create a predictive model that identifies patterns and factors leading to hotel booking cancellations. By analyzing historical booking data, we can train a machine learning algorithm to predict the likelihood of a future booking being canceled. This will help hotels to better manage their reservation systems, optimize occupancy rates, and improve revenue management. 

##### Project Title-07: 
Analyze Mental health disorder in Tech Companies 

##### Project Description: 
This project aims to explore and analyze the prevalence, trends, and perceptions of mental health disorders within the tech industry. Mental health is a critical yet often under-addressed issue, especially in fast-paced and high-pressure environments like technology companies. Through this analysis, we hope to uncover patterns, identify risk factors, and highlight the role of workplace culture in mental health outcomes. 

##### Project Title-08: 
HeartGuard : Early Detection of Heart Disease.

##### Project Description: 
Developed a machine learning model for early detection of heart disease.  The project involved data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions. 

##### Project Title-09: 
Wildlife Protection of Endangered Species.

##### Project Description: 
An endangered species is a type of organism that is threatened by extinction. Species become endangered for two main reasons: loss of habitat and loss of genetic variation. The conservation of endangered and rare wildlife is a primary part of preserving biodiversity. The purpose of this project is to intelligently monitor endangered and rare wildlife species by using Machine Learning models with animal data and computational resources from various parks in United States.
